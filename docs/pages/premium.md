There are four steps to take in acquiring and using Premium Content: Buying, Registering, Installing, and Activating

### Buying

The first step to acquiring a premium module (for any system) is purchasing a key; this is completely handled by the content provider. In this case, you can purchase the premium modules at [Cubicle 7's Webstore](https://cubicle7games.com/foundry-vtt-virtual-tabletop-games).

Once purchased, you will receive a key via email (or listed in your C7 account details).

I didn't receive a key!

I have no ability to handle troubleshooting related to issues with purchasing or fulfillment of keys. Please contact Cubicle 7 support at [sales@cubicle7games.com](sales@cubicle7games.com)

### Registering

Once you've received your key, it's time to register it with Foundry! This tells Foundry VTT you're authorized to download and use the purchased module. 

1. First, you need to have an account with Foundry VTT, this should already be the case if you have the Foundry software. 
2. Once you've logged into your account, go to [your profile](https://www.foundryvtt.com/me) and select **Purchased Content**
3. There you'll find a place to enter your key, once you've done so, you should receive a confirmation message.

### Installing

Once you've registered your purchased module, you can install it in your FoundryVTT software! To do so, simply go to the **Setup** screen of Foundry, navigate to the **<i class="fas fa-plug tab-icon"></i> Add-on Modules** tab, and then click the **<i class="fas fa-download"></i> Install Modules** button. This opens up the Module Browser, which lists every module available to download, so you'll need to search for the module you purchased. Once found, click the **<i class="fas fa-download"></i> Install** button to begin downloading.

{: .question}
It says I don't own the module! 

If you see **<i class="fas fa-lock"></i> Not Owned** next to the module you purchased, don't fret, sometimes it takes time for your software to reflect your purchase. Try restarting your server, if available. Regardless, it will show up eventually.

### Activating

Now, you've installed the module onto your Foundry software, but it doesn't just assume you want to use it in all your worlds, so now we need to activate the module to use in your game. 

1. Launch the world you want to use the module with.
2. Once loaded, go to the **<i class="fas fa-cogs"> </i> Settings** tab.
3. Click the **Manage Modules** button. 
4. Find the desired module, and click the checkbox next to it.
5. Click **Save Module Settings**

{: .question}
I still don't see any Actors or Items!

Content provided by modules is always delivered via the Compendium, check the <i class="fas fa-atlas"></i> Compendium Tab to see all the compendium packs available.

### Initializiation 

The process above is universal for all Foundry modules, the Warhammer modules goes through an additional, optional step of **Initialization**
