{: .warning}
> Do you have an **immediate/time sensitive** problem (e.g. you're in the middle of a session and you need help)? Your best course of action is to **join a Discord and ask the question there**. The Bug Reporter or Email will not have a quick response time and are not very suitable for back-and-forth troubleshooting.  
>
> [FoundryVTT Discord (recommended)](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) - Describe your problem in the `#warhammer` channel for support.  
> [Moohammer Discord](https://discord.gg/GrMcdeDHh8) - Describe your problem in the `#wfrp` channel for support.  
> [Rat Catcher's Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/key8RMSCSb) - Describe your problem in the `#the-foundry-vtt` channel for support.  
>
> *Even so, there might simply not be anyone online that can help. You can also send a message to me directly on Discord (`moo.man`), and I will try to help if I am available.*

{: .question}
Did you find a typo or some data error?

Fill out a Bug Report, selecting the `Domain` as whatever module has the error, and select `Text or Data` as the Label

{: .question}
Is some automated behavior not working right?

The first step in troubleshooting should **ALWAYS** be disabling all non-official modules. If the behavior persists and you are confident it's not the correct behavior, fill out a Bug Report

If you're not confident or unsure, you can always pop in one of the Discords (see above) to ask!

### Frequently Encountered Problems

{: .question}
All of the Talent Bonuses have disappeared from the roll dialog, so I can't select them to gain bonus SL.

This is a consequence of the Effect Refactor. You are likely using Talents that have Effects coded from before the Refactor. See the [Effect Refactor](./effects/effect-refactor#tldr-what-should-i-do-so-my-game-doesnt-break)
